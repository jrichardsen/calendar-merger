# CalMerger

This is an android app to combine multiple local calendars into a single calendar. The merged calendar is read-only and can be used by calendar apps to quickly toggle the visibility of the underlying group of calendars (such as the calendars belonging to your significant other). The events from the original calendars are regularly synchronized to the merged calendar (an interval from 15 minutes to 24 hours can be selected from the applications settings). Since this only requires local database access, the synchronization is fast and power-efficient.
